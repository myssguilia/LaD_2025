Speaker1		but i'm tryin' to think which memory is (0.6) within five minutes because they're all short (.) cute moments
Speaker1		okay i (.) would (.) .hhh
Speaker1		.hhh >°I don't know°< could be about the: (.) the camera cap
Speaker1		[that] (.) ((laugh 0.5)) on our first trip (1.6) >to london a year ago<
Speaker1		°do we° just launch into the memo[ry]
Speaker1		but do you remember how you lost the: (.) camera cap (0.4) at the airport check in
Speaker1		is that not a good memory
Speaker1		[>because<]
Speaker1		[neck]
Speaker1		w(h)e had a lot of luggage
Speaker1		for f[our days]
Speaker1		[for four days]
Speaker1		i think you:: (.) have (.) you just picked up your camera (.) and then the front cap of the camera fell into the belt
Speaker1		[i think it fell off (.) outside already (.) maybe a few t]ime[s]
Speaker1		the conveyor b[elt]
Speaker1		[into the machinery of the actual] airport
Speaker1		((laughs 0.7)) it wa(h)s
Speaker1		((laugh))
Speaker1		th(h)[e first trip with] (.) blurry pictures
Speaker1		[the]y end up blurred anyway 'cause i'm terrible at taking photos
Speaker1		[and we're clumsy]
Speaker1		but i feel like maybe today w- because we've-
Speaker1		the cap is over there  
Speaker1		[and it] still hasn't been cleaned (0.4) from having been down (.) in the gutter at [the air-]
Speaker1		[tha-] y- you see the cap >was actually< found
Speaker1		yesterday
Speaker1		and (1.1) [it ne]eds to be wa[shed]
Speaker1		and it just a(h)nd existed there
Speaker1		having (.) laid in: (0.5) old (.) airport check in bel[t]
Speaker1		[(??)]
Speaker1		[mh]
Speaker1		((laugh 1.0)) into] the [gap]
Speaker1		y(h)ea(h)h
Speaker1		y(h)ea(h)h
Speaker1		[your whole arm]
Speaker1		[ye-]
Speaker1		[but] he- he didn't get it either
Speaker1		i had to then climb over AFTER hi(h)m ((laugh 1.0)) 
Speaker1		and lay flat on the conv[eyer belt] (.) to get my arm all the way in there
Speaker1		[>the lady] didn' t try once by the way
Speaker1		 i cannot believe she didn't even attem[pt<] (0.3) WITH LIKE A PEN (0.5) maybe a magnet
Speaker1		[ye(h)a(h)h]
Speaker1		ye(h)[a(h)h]
Speaker1		((laugh 0.5)) [(??)]
Speaker1		[an-]
Speaker1		[but worst of >all also<] this was (.) >the first< (.) ten minutes of our trip

Speaker1		[and-]
Speaker1		[a]nd all i thought is (.) >thi[s has to] be a good trip<
Speaker1		we [have to make] it (.) past this trip
Speaker1		((laugh)) [(???)]
Speaker1		that's right we could've [dropped anything on that ↑be]lt
Speaker1		((laugh))
Speaker1		[that- that is (.)] tr[ue]
Speaker1		[she just watched]
Speaker1		>she prob(h)ably< served someone [else] (1.1) while we were searching f[or it]
Speaker1		we got the cap
Speaker1		[te(h)- te(h)-]
Speaker1		per day (.) ten more times
Speaker1		because (0.5) that surely cannot be how a cap is supposed t[o be] if- [fa]lling off every time you touch someone,
Speaker1		FOURT- (.) yes for two [pieces of plastic]
Speaker1		((laugh))
Speaker1		NOW it is two glasses of wine (.) back then it was two glasses of wine
Speaker1		°yeah all shitt[y yes°]
Speaker1		>but i think in london we actually said< we would (0.6) personally modify the cap to create a hook (.) ((laugh)) that (.) glues to the c[amera]
Speaker1		but it still ha- hasn't happen
Speaker1		it stil[l:] (.) [it's st(h)ill it's still] in (.) stage one >where it has to be wa[shed<]

Speaker2		[no]
Speaker2		yes, (.) in which we discovered that (0.5) one, (.) a replacement cap was <fourteen> pounds
Speaker2		[which is (.) a gl]ass of wine, (.) not worth it
Speaker2		((laugh))
Speaker2		[tw-]
Speaker2		((laugh))
Speaker2		tw(h)o glasses of wine (.) not worth it,
Speaker2		u:hm two, (1.2) he said all the caps are shitty
